I'm Zhenyi Wang, currently a Postdoctoral Associate at University of Maryland, College Park, working with Prof. Heng Huang. Previously, I received my PhD from Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University at Buffalo in 2023, working with Prof. Mingchen Gao.

**Research Summary:**
My long-term research goal is to develop artificial general intelligence (AGI) that is data-efficient, capable of continual learning and trustworthy. Specifically, I have developed algorithms across the following research areas: (1) Biologically and Neuroscience-Inspired Continual Learning. (2) AI safety for responsible AGI, focusing on protecting model intellectual property and ensuring appropriate usage through applicability authorization mechanisms. (3) Data-efficient learning, including limited labeled data learning and data-free multi-task model merge.

Specifically:
